The repo for a00 is here: https://github.com/comp426-2022-spring/a00\nTo create an issue for a00, go here: https://github.com/comp426-2022-spring/a00/issues\nThis will help the instructional staff address your issues more efficiently and effectively during office hours.\nIt will also help triage and sort out issues that multiple students are having.\nPlease create an issue BEFORE you come to office hours.\nInclude a description of your issue, error logs, and screenshots to help us better understand what is happening.\nPlease use issues instead of email for help with assignments. If you email the instructional staff with questions about assignments, you will be directed to create an issue on the appropriate GitHub repo.\nGitHub discussions for other stuff If you do not have something that you think is worthy of an issue, but would like to discuss it with the instructional staff or other students, please use the discussion that has been set up for the general-info repo.\nAnnouncements will also be posted here and be marked as such.\n","description":"Syllabus day `\u0026\u0026` Using GitHub for class","id":0,"section":"w","tags":null,"title":"w00 Onboarding","uri":"https://comp426.johndmart.in/w/00/"},{"content":"DUE: 2022-01-21T00:00:00-5:00\nThe purpose of this is assignment is to get familiar with the tools that we will be using in COMP 426 for the rest of the semester as well as the assignment submission process.\nNote that this first assignment, a00, is graded only for general completion. Future assignments will be much deeper in scope, and you should expect to spend significantly more time on them.\nInstall Required Software Below are links to guides for installing the required software for this course. It is all free software and it is mostly open source software, with the exception of Chrome. Chrome is built on the Google\u0026rsquo;s open source Chromium code base, BUT Chrome itself is licensed as proprietary software.\nYou are not expected to purchase software for this course.\nThis software must be installed on your computer not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours.\nYou will be installing the following:\n Chrome (web browser) Node.js (Javascript Runtime) git (version control/wofkflow management) bash (command shell) - Windows users will need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. MacOS and Linux users will already have this installed. VSCode / VIM (text editor)  You do not have to use a specific text editor for this class. HOWEVER, you should use a code editor that has good syntax highlighting.\nI encourage you to install and learn VIM in addition to or instead of VSCode.\nVisual Studio Code is recommended for COMP 426 as it is installable cross-platform and is also configured as the default IDE for our GitHub classroom assignments.\nWhenever you are installing software for development purposes, you should pay attention to version and backward compatibility.\nUnderstand the difference between current or latest versions and the Long Term Support (LTS) versions of packages you are using.\nIn this course we will use the current Node LTS version 16.13.2 (LTS). Node flipped from 14 as the LTS version to 16 in November 2021, so some techniques might need adapting but we will deal with that as it comes.\nMy recommendation is that you use a Node version manager of some kind to install and manage Node. It makes knowing what version you are using and keeping it up-to-date a lot easier.\nA note on installing software I am not going to labor over teaching you to install software in this class.\nYou are in a programming class. It is my expectation that you have, at the very minimum, the ability to understand how to install and configure software.\nThe instructional staff is happy to help you if you run into snags, but bear in mind that before you come to us with questions related to software installation and management, you should have exhausted all available resources in the form of documentation and reading (and Googling) error messages, etc.\nThis is your first opportunity for a bit of \u0026ldquo;Physician, healh thyself,\u0026rdquo; in this class.\nYou can do these things. You can FIGURE OUT HOW to do these things.\nI believe in you.\nWindows If you are running Windows, follow the Windows setup guide.\nREMEMBER: if you are using Windows, it is super important that you pay special attention to installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nThis will allow you to run a Linux development environment, which is hugely helpful to you as a skill, and also makes teaching this course more straightforward, because everyone will have access to a UNIX-like system to develop on.\nMac If you have a Mac running OSX, follow the Mac setup guide.\nLinux If you run Linux, and you don\u0026rsquo;t already have the above list installed, you can follow the Linux setup guide.\nJoin GitHub classroom  Make sure you are logged into GitHub: https://github.com/login If you do not have a GitHub account, then create one and log in. Use the assignment link for this assignment: https://classroom.github.com/a/V3VIssyS.a On the next page, click the green button that says \u0026ldquo;Accept this assignment.\u0026rdquo; Read the text on the page that follows. It will say that it is configuring your repository and that you should refresh the page. Refresh the page. You will now see a page that shows a link to your repository. NB: This repository doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist under your GH account directly, but under the \u0026ldquo;organization\u0026rdquo; that owns the GitHub Classroom (jdmar3-comp426). Open the link to your repository page for a00, which should have the form of https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.  Set Up Workspace Now that you have installed all the preqrequisite software and joined our GitHub classroom, you can create your workspace and organize yourself for class.\nOur recommendation is that you create a directory called \u0026ldquo;comp426\u0026rdquo; or something similar which you will use to keep all of your work in.\nYou will have a repository for each assignment and so you can use this directory to clone all of your repos into.\nSome of the assignments have their own starter code and some are just blank repos that you will commit your code to and then push back up to GitHub.\nClone the starter code repo There are multiple ways to clone a repo and get yourself up and running.\nBelow we will detail doing this in VSCode and in a Bash shell.\nVSCode  Open Visual Studio Code (You can also do this by clicking on the VSCode button right in your repo page. You will have to authorize VSCode to use your GH account to install a GitHub Classroom plugin.) Click the Explorer tab on the left. You will see a button that says \u0026ldquo;Clone Repository\u0026rdquo; (hopefully). Follow the prompts for authorizing VSCode to use your GH account. You should see a bar at the top that says \u0026ldquo;Provide repository URL or pick a repository source.\u0026rdquo; Go back to your repository page for your repository and click the green button that says \u0026ldquo;Code.\u0026rdquo; Copy the repo link. Paste the link into the repository bar and press enter. It will prompt you for a location to clone the repo into. Once it is cloned, VSCode will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Open it. You should now see the contents of your repository in VSCode.  BASH $ cd Documents $ mkdir comp426 $ cd comp426 $ git clone https://github.com/jdmar3-comp426/`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`.git Cloning into 'a00-johnmar3'... remote: Enumerating objects: 12, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (12/12), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done. remote: Total 12 (delta 2), reused 2 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (12/12), 14.37 KiB | 7.19 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done. $ cd a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME $ ls Et voila! You are in the directory containing your repository! You should be able to see the base files in the repository after your ls command. Now you can open in it whatever editor you wish.\nCreate a demo project After completing the last section, your computer should be set up for developing websites in COMP 426! Let\u0026rsquo;s run through a quick demo to make sure everything works.\nFor this demo, we\u0026rsquo;re going to pretend we\u0026rsquo;re starting a new web dev project. We\u0026rsquo;ll set up a new project directory using npm and Visual Studio Code. Pay close attention to this process, because you\u0026rsquo;ll want to repeat it every time you start working on a new COMP 426 assignment that does not already have a packages.json file in it. In fact, this process can even be used outside of class in the real world to get set up working on new web-based projects.\nCreate a project directory and initialize with npm The first step for starting a new project is usually to create a new folder that will store your project code. However, for this assignment and for others, you will already have a directory created when you clone your assignment repo. You can see these folders in the left side panel of Visual Studio Code, which shows the file explorer.\nThe file explorer can be toggled open or closed by clicking on the pictured icon.\nIf you were going to be creating a new project folder, you could do it by right clicking in the empty space at the bottom of the explorer and clicking \u0026ldquo;New Folder.\u0026rdquo; However, for this demo we will just use the existing folder a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.\nNext, right click on the folder a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME and click \u0026ldquo;Open in Terminal.\u0026rdquo; This will open a new terminal window pointing at the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder. This raises an important fact about terminals\u0026mdash;they always point to a specific folder location in your computer. Usually, the terminal prompt will give some indication of which folder it is currently pointing at. For instance, you might see something like this:\n1  your-computer-name:`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` yourname$   The important thing here is a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME, which indicates that you are currently in the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder.\nThere is a special terminal command, pwd, which tells you exactly which folder the terminal is currently in. pwd stands for \u0026ldquo;print working directory.\u0026rdquo; Try running pwd in your terminal window now, and verify that it is pointing to the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder.\n1 2  $ pwd /home/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/comp426/`a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME`    Whenever you are working on a particular assignment, it is absolutely crucial that you run any related terminal commands from inside the assignment\u0026rsquo;s folder.\n Once you have confirmed that your terminal is pointing to the a00 folder, run the command npm init. This command tells npm to create a brand new web project in the current folder. As part of the initialization process, it\u0026rsquo;ll ask you a long list of questions about your new web project. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to just press enter through all the prompts.\n1  $ npm init    What does running npm init actually do? It\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty simple: it just creates a new package.json file in the current directory. The package.json file is npm\u0026rsquo;s version of a configuration file for your entire web project. It includes lots of valuable information about your project including the project\u0026rsquo;s name, version, description, and author. It also includes a list of the dependencies that your project relies on, and a list of custom scripts, or actions, that may be a part of your web application. The answers you type to the questions asked during the npm init process are used to add more information to the package.json file that is created for your project.\n At this point, the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder should now have a brand new package.json file with the following contents:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;index.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;echo \\\u0026#34;Error: no test specified\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;license\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ISC\u0026#34; }   Add some HTML Next, let\u0026rsquo;s add some html. Right click on the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder, select \u0026ldquo;New File,\u0026rdquo; and name the new file index.html.\nWrite (do not copy and paste) the following code into the new file and save:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026#34;viewport\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Alphabet\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Alphabet table\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th\u0026gt;Column 0\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt;\u0026lt;th\u0026gt;Column 1\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/thead\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;C\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;D\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;E\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;F\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;G\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;   Commit changes You have just added a file. Save it and then look at the tabs on the left. You should see one that has a blue dot with a number: it is the source control tab. This means that you have changes you need to commit.\nYou can review the changes and explore the tree, etc. For now, click the check mark, which will trigger a commit. A bar will appear at the top asking you to write a commit message. Write something meaningful to let your future self know what you did: \u0026ldquo;added index.html\u0026rdquo;.\nTo make a commit in your terminal from inside the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME directory, run the following:\n$ git add -v . $ git commit -a -m \u0026quot;added index.html\u0026quot; The first command adds any new files that you created. The second command commits the changes and leaves a log message. Make commits anytime you add or edit files after you have tested them to make sure they are working properly. To test them, keep following these instructions.\nInstall Browsersync Next, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use npm to add our first dependency to the new a00 web project. The package we\u0026rsquo;ll add is called Browsersync, and it will help make web development much easier! Browsersync is a \u0026ldquo;dev server,\u0026rdquo; and its job is to show you what your website looks like in real time as you actively make changes to your code. Browsersync works by pretending to be a real web server, running in the background on your computer and monitoring changes to the files in your project directory. Although it\u0026rsquo;s optional, you may wish to install and use Browsersync when working on all assignments for COMP 426.\nTo install Browsersync as a dependency for a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME, run the following command inside the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME terminal:\n1  $ npm install browser-sync    Remember back in Section 2.2 when we ran npm install to install dependencies for the COMP 426 code? This time we\u0026rsquo;re adding the extra word (called a command line argument) browser-sync to the command. This tells npm to search online for the package named browser-sync, add it as a dependency to our new project a00, and download it. One simple command automatically added a powerful third-party program to your new app\u0026mdash;without even writing a single line of code! We\u0026rsquo;ll be using npm install a lot this semester to add other third-party packages to our code.\n Note: To get credit for a00, you must have Browsersync added as a dependency to your project.\nStart the development server With the simple index.html file in place, its time to see if things actually work. Using the terminal inside the a00-$YOURGITHUBUSERNAME folder, run the following command to start the development server:\n1  $ npx browser-sync start -sw   A browser window should have been automatically opened, showing the HTML page we created in the prior step. If not, open http://localhost:3000/ in Google Chrome. You should see the text inside the \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; now being rendered on the website.\n Note: The command npx browser-sync start -sw is worth memorizing, especially if you plan to use Browsersync for assignments in COMP 426 (which is highly recommended). Browsersync is actually quite a powerful tool, although we won\u0026rsquo;t get into the more advanced features. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in learning more, here\u0026rsquo;s a list of the supported command line options. The -sw part of the command tells Browsersync to serve your files locally and actively watch for changes that you may be making to the code. Because we didn\u0026rsquo;t install the browser-sync globally we need to use the npx command to run it locally.\n Edit Some HTML The beauty of using a local web server as you develop is that every time you save your changes, the updated version of the website will be immediately shown in the browser window.\nTo demonstrate this, we\u0026rsquo;re about to make a change to the index.html file created earlier. The instant you save the changes you make, you should see the webpage automatically reload to reflect the change. This makes development much easier and faster. Get used to this workflow because it is a standard method for viewing changes as you are making them and it will make the rest of your assignments MUCH easier!\nOpen your index.html file and find the last row of the table that you created earlier. It should look like this:\n1 2 3  \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;?\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt;   Now look at the table in browser sync.\nYou will see that some of the letters of the alphabet are in Column 0 and others are in Column 1.\nI want you to complete the table, by adding a new row for each remaining letter of the alphabet.\nPlace the remaining letters for subsequent rows in either Column 0 OR Column 1, BUT NOT both. You can place them into columns in whatever way makes some kind of sense to you. Just make sure that there is one letter and one blank cell per row.\nAs you go, save the changes you are making, and watch the webpage instantly reload in the browser and add new rows to your table!\n If you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows, save by pressing Ctrl + S on your keyboard. If you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, save by pressing Cmd + S.  Stop the development server You may have noticed that back in Visual Studio Code, the terminal panel still looks something like this:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no dollar-sign prompt ($), and the terminal won\u0026rsquo;t let you type text into it. This is because Browsersync is still running and is using up that whole terminal. If you ever needed access to a second terminal while Browsersync was running, you could always start up another one with View -\u0026gt; Terminal.\n Visual Studio Code understands that you may need to use multiple terminals at once, and it provides an easy way to switch between them: the small drop-down to the right of the word \u0026ldquo;TERMINAL\u0026rdquo; in the screenshot above. Clicking that drop-down displays a list of all the active terminals running in Visual Studio Code. You can kill, or delete, a terminal with the trash can icon. This immediately terminates whatever process is running in the terminal and shuts that terminal down. Other terminals in Visual Studio Code will be unaffected by this action.\n Whenever you finish working, you may wish to stop the Browsersync development server. One way to do this is by clicking the trash can icon, thereby killing the whole terminal window. Another way is to click back on the terminal that has Browsersync running (see screenshot above) and press the Ctrl + C keys on your keyboard. This should exit Browsersync and return the terminal back to a dollar-sign prompt ($).\n Pressing the Ctrl + C keys while working in a terminal sends a special interrupt (SIGTSTP or \u0026ldquo;terminal stop\u0026rdquo;) to the process currently running on that terminal. That interrupt forces the process to close.\n Submit the assignment If you\u0026rsquo;ve made it to this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve finished a00. The final step is to push the code you created.\nAll assignments in COMP 426 will be submitted by pushing code back to the repository you cloned.\nPush your code  In VSCode, go to the source control tab that you used before. Make sure that all of the changes are committed. Click the little three dot menu a few items away from the check mark. Select \u0026ldquo;Push\u0026rdquo; from the dropdown menu.  THAT\u0026rsquo;S IT! YOU\u0026rsquo;RE DONE WITH THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT!\nThe autograder will do its thing and you should be able to see if your code meets all the requirements by clicking on the Actions tab in your GH repo after you have pushed. The autograder can take a minute or two, so be patient.\nIf your code doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass one of the tests, try to figure out why it didn\u0026rsquo;t pass, fix the error, commit, and push.\nYou can commit and push changes as many times as you need to pass all the tests. This goes for every assignment, not just this one. You always have the option of pushing new changes to autograded assignment repos.\nA note about HTML validation If you copied and pasted the HTML from the above block into index.html, then it will not parse as valid because there are intentional whitespace errors in the example block that you probably missed. It is good practice to run your HTML through a validator. Get into the habit of doing this and learning how to read the output so that you can deal with errors. Familiarize yourself with the W3C validator: https://validator.w3.org, which you can use to validate the HTML for this assignment.\n","description":"This assignment for COMP 426 will help you get through setting up tools and installing some of the basic software you will need to have for the course. It is a walkthrough for installing and setting up your development environment, including: Node.js, VIsual Studio Code, Chrome, git, and using GitHub Classroom for submissions.

In this assignment, you will write a script that uses mostly built-in Node.js modules to serve a single web page from a file that you have stored in a www subdirectory next to your server file.\nThe cool thing about this assignment is that it should take about 20 lines of code in toto.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to build a web server? Yes. That\u0026rsquo;s right. Or maybe you do already? That\u0026rsquo;s okay, too.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t used to know how to build a web server either, but then I hacked one together and now I know how to do that.\nThis assignment is an exercise not in programming as much as it is in being able to figure things out based on information that you have complete access to.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, you can\u0026rsquo;t make mistakes. This assignment is an exercise in hacking something together that works. That, it turns out, is how we do most things. You need to get used to taking a deep breath, centering yourself, and then heading into the unknown.\nYou are not doing this assignment so that you can memorize how to do these things, but rather to give yourself confidence that you, in fact, can figure out how to do these things.\nThe instructions below will not give you full directions for every single step or directive, but instead point you to where you can look to find things that will be helpful.\nTry stuff You will also have to try stuff and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, try something else. Read documentation. Read tutorials. Search for things (Stack Overflow is your friend).\nYou can do this.\nI believe in you.\nGet started We\u0026rsquo;ll get started like we always will: with GitHub.\nFollow the link at the top of this page to accept the assignment through GitHub classroom.\nClone your repository Using VSCode GUI or git in the terminal, clone your repo locally.\nYou should see a couple of files, but it should be mostly empty.\nLike this:\n$ ls LICENSE README.md server.js.example Initialize the repo as an NPM package Run npm init following and fill in the prompts accordingly.\nMake sure to do the following:\n Set author to your name. Set main to server.js. Set test to node server.js Set license to match the one identified in the LICENSE file instead of ISC.  To look up the string that you must put to make that change, find the correct identifier at this site: https://spdx.org/licenses/\nWhen you are done with that, your package.json file should look something like this (though yours will be a little different):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-own-private-web-server\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This package contains a very simple web server that takes one argument for port and then serves index.html in the www directory.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;server.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node server.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;start\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node server.js\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;keywords\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;web\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fs\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;args\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John D. Martin III\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;license\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GPL-3.0-or-later\u0026#34; } }   package.json is just a configuration file, which means that you can always change it later. You do have to be careful when you edit it to ensure that the JSON structure remains intact. See the guides for links to JSON validators that you can use: https://comp426.johndmart.in/guide/validators/#json\nRead through the npm documentation to help you better understand what the init process is doing and what package.json does for you: https://nodejs.dev/learn/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager\nInstall one dependency For this assignment we need to grab one dependency package, minimist. This is going to help us accept arguments from the command line to interact with our web server.\nRun npm install minimist to install the package.\nYou should now see a package-lock.json file and a node_modules subdirectory in your directory as well:\n$ ls node_modules package.json package-lock.json server.js.example Add .gitignore Add a file named .gitignore and put node_modules/ in it:\nnode_modules/ This is going to tell git not to track anything in that directory.\nIf you want a full .gitignore for Node, you can use the text in this file: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore\nMake www directory Create a directory (folder) inside your repo directory called www.\nThis is where we are going to store some HTML.\nIn fact, go and grab the index.html file from a00 (the one with the alphabet table) and put it inside your www directory right now.\nWe will use that as the HTML that we are serving from our web server.\nReady, set, go! With that you are all ready to begin actually writing your web server script.\nRead and code Look inside the server.js.example script file.\nIt should look like this:\n// Require http module // Require fs module // Require minimist module (make sure you install this one via npm). // Use minimist to process one argument `--port=` on the command line after `node server.js`. // Define allowed argument name 'port'. // Define a const `port` using the argument from the command line. // Make this const default to port 3000 if there is no argument given for `--port`. // Use the fs module to create an arrow function using `fs.readFile`. // Use the documentation for the Node.js `fs` module. // The function must read a file located at `./www/index.html` and do some stuff with it. // The stuff that should be inside this function is all below. // If there is an error, put it on the console error, return, and exit with error code 1. // Do not be nice about exiting. // Define a const `server` as an arrow function using http.createServer. // Use the documentation for the node.js http module. // The function should have three responses: // 1. status code 200, // 2. set a header with content type `text/html`, and // 3. end with the data that you are reading in from ./www/index.html. // Start the `server` const listening on the port defined by argument in your `port` const. // Put the exact message `Server listening on port ${port}` on the console log. // That's it! You're all done! You should immediately notice that there is no code here; only comments.\nThat is because YOU are going to write all the code.\nI left blank lines based on how many lines are in minimum working example (MWE) I created when designing this assignment, but you can certainly expand beyond that. The blank lines are just there to give you a sense of what it should look like.\nAs noted above, you can do this in 20 lines.\nInstructions The instructions are in the comments, but I will reiterate them below with links to places in the documentation that will guide you in putting this together.\nThe first thing you need to do is either rename or copy server.js.example to server.js so that you can start writing your server script.\nOverview The resources that you will want to lean on most heavily for this assignment are:\nIntroduction to Node.js - Node.js\nJavaScript Tutorial - w3 schools\nEverything you need to know to build this assignment is contained there.\nThe http module The main thing that we are trying to do in this assignment is make Node serve some HTML for us.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to fancy it up a bit, but this is the main event.\nEverything you need to know to be able to do that is here:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/build-an-http-server\nMore granular documentation of the http module is available here:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-http-module\nSo, start with that.\nGet a very basic web server up and running with the example provided in the link above and then proceed from there.\nThe fs module The next thing that we care about doing is making our web server read from a file and then serve what is in that file instead of just the res.end(Hello, world!)` that our basic web server in the example is doing.\nInstead, you are going to read in the data in ./www/index.html and put that inside res.end instead.\nEverything you need to be able to do that is available here:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/reading-files-with-nodejs\nYou can use either method available in that example, BTW. They do different things, but the end result is the same.\n **HINT: The important bits of your server code (the last two functions in the example) are going to go where console.log(data) is.\n Read the following to better understand what the fs module does, beyond just reading files:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-fs-module\nError handling Pay special attention to the error handling that is happening in the examples on that page.\n1 2 3 4  if (err) { console.error(err) return }   Look here for a deeper understanding of dealing with errors:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/error-handling-in-nodejs\nYou are also going to want to make Node exit the process if there is no file available or if there is some other error. Like it says in the comments, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be nice about that. Also, remember, that the exit code for \u0026ldquo;everything is super great\u0026rdquo; is 0 and the exit code for \u0026ldquo;oh no\u0026rdquo; is 1.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s important.\n Do not worry about using process.exit(1) for this assignment since what we really care about here is the error handling itself.\n The minimist module Finally, we want our script to accept a command line argument to set the port number.\nThere are multiple ways to do this, but we are going to use the minimist module so we can make it operate like the -- switches/options that we see in a lot of programs that we run on the command line.\nEverything that you need to be able to do that is here:\nhttps://nodejs.dev/learn/nodejs-accept-arguments-from-the-command-line\n HINT: You will need to use args.port from your args const in order to define a port const, but use a logical OR operator || to give it the option of defaulting to port 3000 in the case that a port number is not supplied when we run the script. You can use the example that is provided in the link above to figure out how to do this. In that example, process.env.PORT is available to grab the port as defined in the system environment and then 3000 is the default. You will define your const similarly. You can also leave process.env.port in there as another option, but make sure that your default is last.\n The laundry list Here is the list of things that we are looking for in your server.js script:\n Require http module. Require fs module. Require minimist module (make sure you install this one via npm). Use minimist to process one argument --port= on the command line after node server.js. Define allowed argument name \u0026lsquo;port\u0026rsquo;. Define a const port using the argument from the command line. Make this const default to port 3000 if there is no argument given for --port. Use the fs module to create an arrow function using fs.readFile. Use the documentation for the Node.js fs module. The function must read a file located at ./www/index.html and do some stuff with it. If there is an error, put it on the console error, and return~~, and exit with error code 1. Do not be nice about exiting~~. Define a const server as an arrow function using http.createServer. Use the documentation for the node.js http module. The function should have three responses:  status code 200, set a header with content type text/html, and end with the data that you are reading in from ./www/index.html.   Start the server const listening on the port defined by argument in your port const. Put the exact message Server listening on port ${port} on the console log.  These are all of the things that are listed in the comments.\nI will do a walkthrough of this assignment either in class or recorded.\nHowever, I would really encourage you to try it and see what you can come up with before we do that together.\nTo reiterate: the purpose of this assignment is not to memorize things, but to learn how to think around a problem and come up with a solution, given a set of constraints.\nIn this case, our constraints are related to doing this task using stuff that is already (mostly) built into Node.\n IMPORTANT: TRACK YOUR CHANGES. As you work through this assignment, once you get one thing to work, and you test it: commit the change with git. Be intentional about this. This will help you revert to a known working state if you break something as you move to your next step.\n ","description":"This assignment for COMP 426 will help you get started working with Node.js and hacking your way through creating a webserver from scratch.

Whether you know it very well already or if you need a refresher, going through this module and then a01 should put you in a good position to continue through the rest of the assignments.\nKnowing these markup languages is very important for being a good web developer. Both HTML and CSS are straightforward and well-documented.\nWeb langauges and platforms and frameworks change very rapidly and you will, as a web developer, spend a career learning new languages and platforms and frameworks. You will constantly be learning and teaching yourself new things. If you take no other lessons away from this class, take this one: get comfortable looking things up and learning things on your own. It is the only way.\nThe list of resources belows, for example, are the kinds of things that you will want to learn how to find online. Google. Everything.\nHTML describes the web page\u0026rsquo;s structure while CSS describes how that structure should be styled. We are going to provide you a short online course so you can familiarize yourself with these two languages. In the second (after the initial setup) assignment we will be making a simple website using just HTML and CSS. Remember all the assignments are already published so you can look ahead and see what kinds of things you will be expected to do.\nIf you find anything overly confusing, ask on Piazza or reach out during office hours. We will be making it very clear what you will be expected to know for a test when it comes time for that. If you can do the upcoming HTML and CSS assignment a01 without looking things up, then you can consider yourself a genius-level expert. If you can complete a01 while referencing the endless trove of documentation available online, then you are like the rest of us and have a pretty decent working knowledge that is good enough to do web development.\nHTML and CSS is probably the most googleable topic you will ever come across in your CS career. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to look things up, but make sure you aren\u0026rsquo;t just copy-pasting things from Stack Overflow either.\nRecommendations for self Study Code Academy CodeAcademy - Learn HTML and CSS\nYou will have to sign up for an account, but it is totally free. You should complete the following tutorials:\nHTML  Elements and Structure Tables (know the basics) Forms (know the basics there will be an assignment on this later) Semantic HTML (optional and not required, just make yourself familiar with it so you can sound smart if you see it at a job)  CSS  Selectors and Visual Rules The Box Model Display and Positioning Colors (optional) Typography (optional) Grid (Skip this and learn basic Flex) CSS Transitions (optional)  w3schools The w3schools site is an excellent resource for the markup and programming languages that we will be using in this course. Get comfortable working through the tutorials both as self-study resource and as a reference tool.\n w3schools HTML w3schools CSS  Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) The Mozilla Developer Network has excellent guides and documentation on all things related to web development.\n MDN HTML MDN CSS.  TutorialsPoint For those of you who just want to read things I\u0026rsquo;d check out TutorialsPoint\u0026rsquo;s pages on HTML and CSS. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the CSS one is very good and you would be better off with the Code Academy one.\nAssessment There is no graded assessment component for course modules. We will not be giving you graded quizzes or anything. However, it will be effectively impossible to successfully work through any aspect of this course going forward without famililarity manipulating, writing, and editing HTML and CSS.\nHere is a list of online quizzes that you can and should take on your own to test and evaluate your knowledge. It would behoove you to take these quizzes and then review things that you find difficult.

This is a class about building things that make the web go. We\u0026rsquo;re going to learn how to do that by doing that.\nWhat are we doing? This semester we are going to focus on systems for collecting and managing public health information because we are in an ongoing public health crisis and that seems really relevant.\nCOVID-19 is still a thing We\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing Zoom class for the first few weeks until we see how things are going around campus with COVID-19. None of us want to be in a room with 210 other people all breathing the same air right in the middle of a pretty bad surge of a highly transmissible variant of SARS-COV-2 (Omicron edition).\nAfter we start meeting in-person, I will still host all sessions live on Zoom and record them.\nIf you are sick AT ALL IN ANY WAY, then DO NOT COME TO CLASS.\nLog into Zoom or watch the sessions later instead.\nWhat are we going to learn about? We will learn to use a bunch of Node.js packages and write a bunch of JavaScript. We will learn to build and use RESTful APIs. We will learn to build front-end interfaces using JS, HTML, and CSS to send and retrieve information to and from an API/back-end, respectively. Yes, we will make something with React also.\nWhat are the assignments? There is a series of individual assignments intended to help you develop the skills necessary for working on your final project assignment.\nYou will work in a team on a final project application that deals with public health information, which you will begin planning in the second week of class.\nWhat about grades? Grading will be done on a scale of 1,000,000 points. Literally.\nGrading will also be done by robots. We will give you qualitative feedback, too!\nAre there exams? Yeah, but they are not really like the exams you are used to. The exams assess familiarity with concepts and are really an assessment of my teaching rather than your ability to memorize things.\nWhat will class be like? Sometimes I will talk about conceptual stuff on slides. Sometimes I will do live demos of things related to your assignments.\nHow do we do things? We will use GitHub. We will talk about open source and licensing. We will learn how to work collaboratively.\nCTRL+C CTRL+V? Do your own work (but ask for help when you need it). Do original work (but find things that inspire you and build on them). Don\u0026rsquo;t plagiarize existing work (seriously, don\u0026rsquo;t). Reference things that you find useful. Follow the license terms of any code you adapt and identify where it comes from.\n*sigh* Everything is a lot right now. Will it ever get better? Mental health and general well-being are important. We can\u0026rsquo;t learn anything if we are beset at all sides by stress. We have to tke care of ourselves and each other or we are nowhere.\nBe kind to one another and the instructional staff. The instructional staff will be kind to you and we\u0026rsquo;ll all learn some interesting stuff this semester.\n","description":"There is a lot of information here.

So that is fixed now and we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to proceed with demos.\nIf you are interested in learning more about what ports do for us, see the link below.\nAlso, if you are interested in learning to set up a remote server for running things like this, I can post a tutorial.

It will tell you this when you push. Give the staff a couple of days to finish configuring it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything other than push to your assignment repo. When the grader is ready, it will update and spit out feedback.\nWrite some functions and make a module in Node.js In this assignment, you are going to write some functions that emulate a simple random coin flip and then do things with the resulting information. The focus of the assignment is not necessarily on the coin flipping, but on how to work with functions to manipulate information into usable formats.\nThe instructions for this are very sparse because I want you to be creative in how you approach this. There are a few things that you will have to do very specifically in order to make this work, but beyond that, HOW you do this is really up to you.\nSet up your environment As usual, we\u0026rsquo;re starting with a kind of empty repository.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve given you a LICENSE file, a README, and a script called flip.js.\nI have also given you a directory modules with one file in it.\nRun npm init to initialize your repository as a Node package.\nFill in the information as usual and make sure that the license matches the one in the repository.\nOnce you have done that, you should have a package.json file that looks something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;coinflip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a simple package that emulates coin flips in several different ways.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;flip.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;echo \\\u0026#34;Error: no test specified\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John D.

So, let\u0026rsquo;s do that right now.\nAdd \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;module\u0026quot; somewhere. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where: just make sure that you keep the JSON syntax intact (mind the commas).\nAfter that, we want to add a few scripts, because you are going to be creating several script files. This way we can use NPM to invoke them if we want.\nAdd the following under \u0026quot;scripts\u0026quot;: {:\n \u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;node flip.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;flips\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;node flips.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;guess-flip\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;node guess-flip.js\u0026quot;, You can edit the test script line later if you want to develop a test for your scripts (you should do this).\nYour file should now look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;coinflip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a simple package that emulates coin flips in several different ways.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;flip.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;flip\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node flip.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;flips\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node flips.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;guess\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node guess-flip.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;echo \\\u0026#34;Error: no test specified\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;John D.

Both work in this case. You just have to make sure when you are referring to a module file that your reference matches the actual name of the file. See this for more information about module extensions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#aside_%E2%80%94_.mjs_versus_.js\n Inside, you should see some named functions and some comments with instructions. Your task is to follow the instructions and fill in the function definitions with expressions/statements that take the specified parameters and return the speficied returns.\nYou will also need to export all of the functions in that file. There are several ways to do this. See the following and choose a method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export\nWrite a script I\u0026rsquo;ve given you a template for one script. It is pretty straightforward.\nWhen you run node flip.js, in a terminal, you should see either \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tails\u0026rdquo; in STDOUT.\nSo, how do we do that?\nFirst, we have to import one of the functions that we just wrote.\nAgain, there are a number of ways to do this, so start here and identify one that will work for you: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import\nOnce your function is imported, use console.log() to get the returned output from your coinFlip() function into STDOUT.\nEt voila!\nTest your script Since we set npm up to be able to run our script, you should be able to run npm flip and see the output in STDOUT as either \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tails.\u0026rdquo;\nWrite some more scripts To complete the assignment, you will need two more scripts, detailed below:\nFlip many coins Create another script file called flips.js.\nThis script should do the following:\n Take one argument on the command line named --number. If no argument is given, it should flip once by default. The result on STDOUT should be an array of all of the flips in sequence followed by an object summarizing the flips.  So the script should run like this and have similar output\n$ node flips.js --number=10 [ 'heads', 'heads', 'heads', 'tails', 'heads', 'tails', 'tails', 'heads', 'tails', 'heads' ] { tails: 5, heads: 5 } Try your luck Create one more script called guess-flip.js.\nThis script should do the following:\n Take one argument on the command line named --call that will only accept . If no argument is given, or something other than \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;tails\u0026rdquo; is passed with --call, return an error message (see below for example). Compare the call with a flip and report the result to STDOUT (see below)  The script should run like this and have similar output.\n$ node guess-flip.js Error: no input. Usage: node guess-flip --call=[heads|tails] $ node guess-flip.js --call=tails { call: 'tails', flip: 'heads', result: 'lose' } $ node guess-flip.js --call=tails { call: 'tails', flip: 'tails', result: 'win' } Laundry list This is what you should have upon completing the assignment:\n A repo set up as a Node package that can handle a module and has three npm helper scripts defined for your scripts. A module file in ./modules/ that has several functions that emulate coin flips. Three script files that do the following:  flip.js - flips a coin into STDOUT flips.js - flips a bunch of coins into STDOUT based on a number input as a command line argument guess-flip.js - takes an argument calling a coin flip and then testing it against a flip and puts the results into STDOUT    Good luck!\nPS You may run into some errors related to using both ESM and CommonJS methods for importing/requiring dependencies.

The focus of the assignment is not necessarily on creating basic API endpoints in Node using Express.js.\nThe instructions for this are very sparse because I want you to be creative in how you approach this. There are a only a few things that you will have to do very specifically in order to make this work, but beyond that, HOW you do this is really up to you.\nList of requirements for submission  server.js file that takes an arbitrary port number as a command line argument (i.e. I should be able to run it with node server.js. The port should default to 5000 if no argument is given. Default API endpoint that returns 404 Not found for any endpoints that are not defined. Check endpoint at /app/ that returns 200 OK. Endpoint /app/flip/ that returns JSON {\u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;} or {\u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;} corresponding to the results of the random coin flip. Endpoint /app/flips/:number that returns JSON including an array of the raw random flips and a summary. Example below. Endpoint /app/flip/call/heads that returns the result of a random flip match against heads as JSON. Endpoint /app/flip/call/tails that returns the result of a random flip match against tails as JSON. ALL endpoints should return HTTP headers including a status code and the appropriate content type for the response. All of this should be in a Node package with \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; set to server.js. The test script defined in package.json should be set to \u0026quot;node server.js --port=5555\u0026quot;  Examples If I run the following curl commands against your API, I should see output corresponding to what is shown here in STDOUT.\nPLEASE USE CURL to test your endpoints as below RATHER THAN relying on the autograder to tell you what is wrong. You must become accustomed to testing your own scripts.\n$ curl http://localhost:5000/app/ 200 OK $ curl -I http://localhost:5000/app/ i=HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express Content-Type: text/plain Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2022 18:02:32 GMT Connection: keep-alive Keep-Alive: timeout=5 $ curl http://localhost:5000/app/flip/ {\u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;} $ curl -I http://localhost:5000/app/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 16 ETag: W/\u0026quot;10-VYm8Bk1/RW8RGhDXdTwBYk6lbGE\u0026quot; Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2022 18:06:17 GMT Connection: keep-alive Keep-Alive: timeout=5 $ curl http://localhost:5000/app/flips/20 {\u0026quot;raw\u0026quot;:[\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;],\u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;:{\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;:11,\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;:9}} $ curl http://localhost:5000/app/flip/call/heads {\u0026quot;call\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;win\u0026quot;} $ curl http://localhost:5000/app/flip/call/tails {\u0026quot;call\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tails\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;flip\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;heads\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;result\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;lose\u0026quot;} $ curl http://localhost:5000/app/some/nonexistent/endpoint/ 404 NOT FOUND Set up your environment You will need to run npm init like usual and make sure that you make changes according to the list above.\nOnce you have initialized your repo as a Node package, you need to install express. If you are using minimist or yargs or some other package to handle command line arguments, then you need to also install that, e.g.:\n$ npm install express minimist Require dependencies Once you have initialized your repository, you will need to create your script file, server.js and add a few things to get going with express. The first is requiring whatever dependencies you need (including express).\n1 2 3  // Require Express.js const express = require(\u0026#39;express\u0026#39;) const app = express()   Start app server Replace \u0026ldquo;HTTP_PORT\u0026rdquo; below with whatever you are using as your port variable. Alternatively, assign \u0026ldquo;HTTP_PORT\u0026rdquo; as your port variable.\n1 2 3 4  // Start an app server const server = app.listen(HTTP_PORT, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;App listening on port %PORT%\u0026#39;.replace(\u0026#39;%PORT%\u0026#39;,HTTP_PORT)) });   Define default endpoint 1 2 3 4  // Default response for any other request app.use(function(req, res){ res.status(404).send(\u0026#39;404 NOT FOUND\u0026#39;) });   Define check endpoint app.get('/app/', (req, res) =\u0026gt; { // Respond with status 200 res.statusCode = 200; // Respond with status message \u0026quot;OK\u0026quot; res.statusMessage = 'OK'; res.writeHead( res.statusCode, { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain' }); res.end(res.statusCode+ ' ' +res.statusMessage) }); Note the similarities and differences between the above default and check endpoints.\nFill in the blank lines after the comments. in the check endpoint.\nResponse and request You should note that any variable inside your endpoint definitions that have res are properties of the response object from Express (which is an extension of Node\u0026rsquo;s http.ServerResponse class. You can use response properties from that as well. Much of what Express does is redefine them to be shorter and chainable as in the case of the status code examples above.\nSome other response properties you can use are:\n res.json() responds with whatever JSON is contained within it. res.send() responds in plaintext with any message contained therein. res.setHeader() sets one of the HTTP header parameters, like Content-Type.  The full documentation for Express\u0026rsquo;s response object is here: https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res\nThe request object is also available and you can treat these just like any variable.\nFor this assignment you will specifically need req.params to get the number from the URL for your multiple flips endpoint.\nThat endpoint definition will look like this:\napp.get('/app/flips/:number', (req, res) =\u0026gt; { //Some //expressions //go //here }); In the endpoint definition where you see :number, the colon makes that part of the definition into a parameter, which is variable. In this case, you will be using a number.\nYou can get this parameter by referring to req.params.number.\nYou can use whatever you want for this definition. The names of parameters are arbitrary.\nIn this case, you might use something like this to pass that parameter to your coin-flipping function.\napp.get('/app/flips/:number', (req, res) =\u0026gt; { const flips = manyflips(req.params.number) //Other //expressions //go //here }); In the example above, req.params.number can be passed to whatever function we are using to generate a bunch of coin flips.\nThe full documentation for Express\u0026rsquo;s request object is here: https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#req\nFunctions You should already have a bunch of coin flip functions from a02 that you can adapt to use in this server script.\nYou can put them in however you like. You can include them in the server file itself. You can make them into a module. Whatever works for you is fine as long as the endpoints return the appropriate output.\nGood luck! We will be going over parts of this assignment and expanding upon them over the next few weeks in class, so if you are having trouble getting something to work: don\u0026rsquo;t worry. We will likely cover in class at some point soon.\nAlso, be sure to refer to what you have done in previous assignments. These assignments build on one another, so try to carry things over, when appropriate, as you are looking for solutions.\n","description":"This assignment for COMP 426 is intended to help you work through creating an API using Node.js and Express.js.

This is an important piece of building an API, because it allows you to break down what happened if something goes wrong. It also helps other developers use and deploy your software.\nYou should start with your server.js script from a03.\nDocumentation The below code block should serve in part as a guide for this assignement.\nIf your server.js script is run with the option --help, it should echo ONLY the following help message to STDOUT and then exit 0.\n Note that if you try to test this using npx nodemon server.js --help it will display nodemon\u0026rsquo;s help message. Also, in order for this to work properly, the conditional has to come before all of the dependencies in your script, with the exception of whatever library you are using to parse command line arguments (minimist, yargs, etc.).\n server.js [options] --port\tSet the port number for the server to listen on. Must be an integer between 1 and 65535. --debug\tIf set to `true`, creates endlpoints /app/log/access/ which returns a JSON access log from the database and /app/error which throws an error with the message \u0026quot;Error test successful.\u0026quot; Defaults to `false`. --log\tIf set to false, no log files are written. Defaults to true. Logs are always written to database. --help\tReturn this message and exit. As you can see, you will need to include multiple command line options with defaults.\nIf you are using minimist, to do this, look at the documentation to see how arguments are stored in the argv object that minimist gives you: https://github.com/substack/minimist\nCreating a database Use the methods that we have gone over in class to create a database file called log.db using better-sqlite3 with a table named accesslog. Set up the accesslog table with columns corresponding to variables listed below.\nThe notes from w08 should help with this.\nLogging to database Write a middleware function that inserts a new record in a database containing all of the variables in the following data object:\n\tlet logdata = { remoteaddr: req.ip, remoteuser: req.user, time: Date.now(), method: req.method, url: req.url, protocol: req.protocol, httpversion: req.httpVersion, secure: req.secure, status: res.statusCode, referer: req.headers['referer'], useragent: req.headers['user-agent'] } Remember that you have to include next() at the end of your middleware or it will hang.\nAnd also remember to include it in the list of parameters passed to your middleware:\napp.use( (req, res, next) =\u0026gt; { // Your middleware goes here. }) Create endpoints These endpoints should be available if AND ONLY IF the command line option --debug=true is passed when server.js is run.\n/app/log/access Create a new endpoint /app/log/access that returns all records in the accesslog table in your database log.db.\n/app/error Create an endpoint /app/error that returns an error in the response.\nThe error should read \u0026ldquo;Error test successful.\u0026rdquo;\n HINT: This should just work if you model your endpoint on the first example in the error documentation from Express: http://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html#the-default-error-handler\n Create an access log file In addition to the log in your database, if AND ONLY IF --log=true is passed when running server.js, then your server should create a file called access.log and write your access log to it in a combined format.\nUse morgan to accomplish this by sending its output to a write stream from the fs builtin:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ... // Use morgan for logging to files // Create a write stream to append (flags: \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;) to a file const WRITESTREAM = fs.createWriteStream(\u0026#39;FILE\u0026#39;, { flags: \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; }) // Set up the access logging middleware app.use(morgan(\u0026#39;FORMAT\u0026#39;, { stream: WRITESTREAM })) ...   You will need to change everything in ALLCAPS above to suit the instructions.\nList of requirements  Return help message to STDOUT and exit 0 if command line argument --help is passed. Use better-sqlite3 to create a database log.db and populate it with one table accesslog with the variables listed above in the logdata object. Write a middleware function that writes the logdata object variables into the accesslog table in log.db. Create endpoints /app/log/access and /app/error that send a response in the form of an access log and an error test, respectively, when --debug is passed as a command line argument. Write a combined format access log to an access.log file when --log is passed as a command line argument. As usual, include a command line argument to set an arbitrary port number that defaults to 5555.

This module includes some information and links about JS functions and a walkthrough of creating a very basic set. Some of this is covered in the a03 instructions as well. You can use this as a reference to expand on the information presented in the instructions.\nHow do functions work in JavaScript? Functions in JS work prettymuch the way that functions in any langauge work. You are defining something that can be invoked to do a specific set of tasks so that you do not have to write instructions for those tasks over and over again.\n One weird trick: if you find yourself doing something more than once, then you should probably rwrite a function instead of doing that thing over and over again.\n Functions have a very straightforward definition syntax comprising a few parts:\n name, which invokes the function; parameters, which define local variables as arguments when the function is invoked; and code that gets executed by the function.  If we want to get some sort of information out of our function, then we will need our code to include a return, which is all the stuff that you expect the function to spit out so you can do something else with it.\nBasic function definition syntax looks like this:\n1 2 3 4  function name(parameter1, parameter2) { // some code \treturn parameter1 + parameter2; }   As you can see, you can use // to comment single lines in your code inside a function. You can also comment multiple lines by using */ and /* to wrap whatever you want to comment between them. These work across the board in JS and you should be using them in order to leave information for your self. There are tons of examples of comments in a03.\nExport / Import In addition to writing basic functions, we want to be able to olexport them so that we can call them in other places. This requires just a simple modification to the basic syntax listed above:\n1 2 3 4  export function name(parameter1, parameter2) { // some code \treturn parameter1 + parameter2; }   Lets\u0026rsquo;s say we have the above code saved in a file called exports.js.\nTo import the same function, you would need the following in another file, we\u0026rsquo;ll call it main.js. We\u0026rsquo;ll also add an invocation of the function.\n1 2 3  import {name} from \u0026#34;./exports.js\u0026#34;; name(5,6);   In order to get the above to spit out the return value in the terminal, we need to wrap the call in the above block of code with a console.log() function.\n1 2 3  import {name} from \u0026#34;./exports.js\u0026#34;; console.log(name(5,6));   That should spit out 11 if we were to run main.js in a terminal with node.\nHello, world. In this section, we will do a pretty basic walkthrough for creating, exporting, and importing a \u0026ldquo;Hello, world\u0026rdquo; function. This example will sort of mirror what you are doing in a03.\nGet set up First, open a terminal and create a new directory.\n$ mkdir helloworld Then, let\u0026rsquo;s create some files to get ourselves started.\n$ cd helloworld $ touch helloworld.js $ touch functions.js Then lets initialize our directory as an npm package. You can just accept the defaults suggested by npm.\n$ *npm* init In order to run this, we\u0026rsquo;ll need some help from the ESM package, so let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and install that now.\n$ *npm* install esm  Normally when you want to run a .js file you just use the command line and call node FileName.js. But because the es6 import and export syntax is experimental in node, we need to use a package called ESM. For us, the user, the only difference is that we now run our node command as follows: node -r esm FileName.js. ESM will not be required in later versions of node.\n Write some code! Now we can open helloworld.js and we\u0026rsquo;ll put the following code in it.\n1 2 3  export function helloWorld(message) { return `Hello, world ${message}` }   Save that script and let\u0026rsquo;s think about what we just did for a minute.\nIn the above script we are defining a function helloWorld() and exporting it so that we can import it and then invoke it elsewhere. It has one parameter, which we have defined as message. Whatever value we insert as the message is going to get returned after the words \u0026ldquo;Hello, world\u0026rdquo;. If you leave the function empty, it will just return \u0026ldquo;Hello, world.\u0026rdquo;\nSo if we want to say \u0026ldquo;Hello, world and exit\u0026rdquo;, then we would call `helloWorld(\u0026lsquo;and exit\u0026rsquo;). There are other ways to do this. The code you see above is one example of how to do this. You may find other examples that work and that is fine.\nNow we need to import our function and call it.\nOpen the main.js file that we created earlier. Put the following in it.\n1 2 3  import {helloWorld} from \u0026#34;./helloworld\u0026#34;; console.log(helloWorld(\u0026#39;and exit\u0026#39;));   Now, what are we doing here?\nWe are importing our previously defined and exported function helloWorld from the helloworld.js script we created earlier. We are using a path relative to our current working directory: ./ means \u0026ldquo;this directory.\u0026rdquo; Since helloworld.js is stored in the same directory, ./helloworld.js means \u0026ldquo;the hello_world.js script stored in this directory.\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to put the file extension in the script. Node will assume that we are asking for a JS file.\nNext, we are invoking our function helloWorld(). If we just invoke that on its own, it will not output anything in the terminal. To get it to do that, we need to wrap the function call in console.log().\nSave that file and we\u0026rsquo;ll see if it works!\nRun it! Alright, we\u0026rsquo;ve written some scripts and we have our directory set up with npm. We should be ready to run this and see if it works.\nTo run your script, run the first line in the example below and you should see the output on the second line:\n$ node -r esm main.js Hello world, and exit. You can also have Node run this interactively so that you can change what the function is saying.\nRun:\nnode -i -r esm \u0026gt; The \u0026gt; means that we are in an interactive node session and it is expecting us to type something. So lets type some stuff. Let\u0026rsquo;s import our function (HINT: we do the same thing that we did in the file, but just live on the command line).\n\u0026gt; import {helloWorld} from './helloworld.js' undefined \u0026gt; Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the \u0026ldquo;undefined\u0026rdquo; thing. It\u0026rsquo;s misleading. It is saying that here was no console output defined, so it echoes \u0026ldquo;undefined.\u0026rdquo;\nWe can turn this off, but for now we\u0026rsquo;re not going to worry about it.\nNext let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens if we continue with our interactive Node session and call our helloWorld() function with different arguments.\n\u0026gt; import {helloWorld} from './helloworld.js' undefined \u0026gt; helloWorld() 'Hello, world undefined' \u0026gt; helloWorld('') 'Hello, world ' \u0026gt; helloWorld('.') 'Hello, world .' \u0026gt; helloWorld('and exit.') 'Hello, world and exit.' \u0026gt; Press CTRL+C twice or type .exit to exit the Node interactive session.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! We did it! We defined a function, exported it, imported it, and made it do things!\nnpm test If you open up package.json you will notice that there is a field for a test.\nWe left this undefined earlier, but let\u0026rsquo;s define it so that we have another way of running a test of our function.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s put the command that we used to run our main.js file in that field as a test.\nTo do this, make your package.js file look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;helloworld\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;node -r esm main.js\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;license\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ISC\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;esm\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^3.2.25\u0026#34; } }   Now, we can run the following in the terminal and it will run the command we set as a test and should generate output that looks like the example below.\n$ npm test \u0026gt; helloworld@1.0.0 test \u0026gt; node -r esm main.js Hello, world and exit. This all feeds directly into a03, which will have you defining a bunch of functions that do different things.\n","description":"Get started writing and calling basic functions in JavaScript.","id":12,"section":"module","tags":null,"title":"mod03 JavaScript Functions","uri":"https://comp426.johndmart.in/module/mod03/"},{"content":"Functions and Evolution 2022-01-27T15:30:00-05:00\n Old-school JS and modern JS History and evolution Functions three ways  Slides https://comp426-2022-spring.github.io/slides/w03-00.html\nUseful links Evolution JavaScript History - w3schools\nDifference between ES5 and ES6 - GeeksforGeeks\nDifference between ES6 and TypeScript\nDifference between JavaScript and TypeScript\nFunctions Functions - MDN Web Docs\nJavaScript Functions\nJavascript Intro to Functions - Learn.co\nJavaScript Functions - JavaScript Tutorial\nFunctions - learn-js.org\nJavaScript Function Definitions\nES6 arrow functions Javascript Arrow Function\nArrow functions for beginners - Brandon Morelli\nArrow functions vs regular functions in JavaScript - Madhavan Nagarajan\nWhen (and why) you should use ES6 arrow functions — and when you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t - Cynthia Lee\nTypeScript functions The TypeScript Handbook\nIntroduction to TypeScript - GeeksforGeeks\nMore on Functions - TypeScript\nNotes History JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich.\nIn 1996, it was developed into a standard scripting langage by ECMA\u0026rsquo;s (then the European Computer Manufacturers Association) Technical Committe (TC39) and released as ECMAScript 1 (ES1) in 1997.\nTypeScript was developed and released by MicroSoft in 2012 to deal with some of the deficits of JS as a programming language.\nIt is technically a superset of ES6 (which is a superset of ES5).\nThe current release of TypeScript (TS4.5) incorporates ES2022 modules and is supported by Node.js 16.x.x.\nSemicolons It turns out that the seemingly arbitrary and undisciplined way I use semicolons is\u0026hellip; fine I guess?\nI have always just used them intuitively based on what I thought was happening and I realize now that my usage was a vestige of writing bash scripts, where they have somewhat more explicit use as a command terminator. So when I would write one-liners, this was the mechanism that I used to put the lines together into one.\nApparently some people get mad about semicolons in JS.\nThis is a good discussion of what semicolons are doing in JS and where the parser inserts them automatically and why: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lets-talk-about-semicolons-in-javascript-f1fe08ab4e53/\nSo, my advice is to use them if you feel like it and if you ever encounter someone who gets super upset about them, then avoid that person.\nThis Regular functions bind their own scope whereas arrow functions inherit from the parent scope.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that arrow functions are limited in terms of what they can and can\u0026rsquo;t do:\n No binding to this Can\u0026rsquo;t use as methods or constructors No good for bind(), call(), and apply() No good for anything that rely on a scope  But they can be used with closures and are nice for when we are creating API endpoints, which we will do next week.\nModules and export 2022-02-01T15:30:00-05:00\nSlides https://comp426-2022-spring.github.io/slides/w03-01.html\nUseful links Modules, export, and import Export and Import - JavaScript.info\nThe module object - Node.js\nNode.js export module - GeeksforGeeks\nNode Module Exports Explained – With JavaScript Export Function Examples - Stanley Nguyen\nMDN links JavaScript Modules\nExport\nImport\nESM and CommonJS issues You\u0026rsquo;re going to run into issues related to using the module, export, import.\nBasically, you can\u0026rsquo;t use require('blahblah') with ESM modules and you can't use import` with CJS modules.\nBUT THAT IS OKAY!\nBecause there is a way to make it happen.\nModule API module.createRequire() - Node.js\nParsing command line arguments How to parse command line arguments - Node.js\nCommand Line Arguments in Node.js - Scott Robinson\nHow to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js - Rahul Kumar\n","description":"This week we will discuss and demo writing functions to simplify repeated or recurring rasks.

So, there is not assignment invite link for a99.\nGeneral final project issues and questions: https://github.com/comp426-2022-spring/a99\nSpecific issues should be addressed with your assigned instructional staff member via issues inside your team\u0026rsquo;s assignment repository.\nOverview As a small team, you will create an app that relates to providing, managing, collecting, or tracking information related to a public health event, phenomenon, or policy. This can take many forms, so here are a few ideas of the kind of app we are looking for:\n COVID-19 info dashboard Annual flu tracking app Disability advocacy platform Tracking app/portal for accessing mental health resources and information Emergengy/disaster management provider/public portal Disease outbreak tracking/prediction map Personal health information management app Public health historical information/data preservation and archiving system Portable universal electronic health record (EHR) system*   * This is sort of a reach for the stars type of idea. It\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible that someone may figure this problem out and develop a system or protocol for this that has the potential for wide adoption and there are a lot of really smart people working on it, BUT NO ONE HAS DONE IT YET. So, now is your chance to invent a thing that will revolutionize health care records management while also being compliant with personal health records laws in all of the places it may be used and does not face resistance from existing proprietary EHR vendors, etc. You can do it. I believe in you.\n Your team will be responsible for scoping, planning, and designing an app or system like one of those listed above, and also programming a working prototype.\nThe app should be fully documented, including setup instructions, full API documentation, and user instructions, as well as your planning workflow (notes, GitHub Project boards, discussions archives, etc.).\nYour team will create a \u0026lt;= 3-minute video describing your app to present to the class about your app. This can be a very basic walkthrough, or a description/presentation of features/use cases, or something else. Be creative. Think of it as an opportunity to hone your ability to pitch an idea that you have in prototype (because that is what it is).\nPhases Phase 1: Scoping and Planning In the planning phase, your team should start with brainstorming ideas and begin to develop an idea of what you want to create an app to do, what is feasible, and what you need to know to proceed. Your team will also want to think about task and labor structure: who is going to do what? Who keeps track of what? Who works on what aspects? Who is good at what?\nWhen? Ideally your team will begin this process by the last week in February.\nWhat to do? Set up a Project board on GitHub and assign it to your team so that you can manage brainstorming ideas and transition into designing and documenting. Choose a license. Use the README to document general information about the project and instructions to install or run it in whatever state it happens to be throughout the project.\nPhase 2: Designing and documenting In this phase, your team should begin sketching out the major parts of the system or app and looking at similar or related concepts to understand the state of the art. This is a good time to figure out how someone else is approaching a certain problem related to your app or system. Your team should use this information to then extend, adapt, and improve existing approaches, or make a radical departure and try something entirely new.\nWhen? In the beginning of March, your team should be pulling together a system design and documenting it in your team\u0026rsquo;s Project board and repository. During spring break, step back from the project and incubate the ideas and designs/sketches/schematics/plans/etc. that you have been working with. When we return from spring break, your team should start working on programming base components, laying out package structure, and making decisions about how different parts are articulated together.\nWhat? Keep notes and documentation in whatever form it takes in your teams\u0026rsquo;s GH repo. Use the project management tools in GitHub to keep track of things. Create a basic repository structure that your team can fork to begin working on components and features.\nPhase 3: Prototyping and Pitch In the last phase of this project, your team will pull together a working prototype. It does not have to be complete or polished: it just has to do the things that you want it to do in some form. You should also be cleaning up your documentation and moving it from documenting what was planned to documenting what is being executed in the prototype. This means noting what is currently working and what is not yet working or may work in a later iteration the design.\nYour team will also be working on a three-minute-or-less (\u0026lt;= 3 min) pitch video to show in one of the sessions in the last several sessions of class (21 and 26 April).\nWhen? At the beginning of April, your team should begin pulling a prototype together, settling into a set of prototype version features, and debugging it. Your team should be consolidating, organizing, cleaning-up, and clarifying documentation at this time. Your team should also be organizing the package that will contain all of the parts of your app and its documentation as a prototype release.\nBy mid-April, your team needs to be mostly debugging and working through changes to create your prototype release. During the third week in April, your team needs to create a video and make a pull request to get it in the queue to present during the last two sessions of class.\nWhat? Integrate new features using pull requests to your project repository on GitHub. Move cards from \u0026ldquo;In progress\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Review\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Finished\u0026rdquo; in your project plan. Work on documentation. Organize the software package. Prepare a prototype release. Make a video demo.\nDeliverables A GitHub repository containing your code and documentation and a prototype release package. Your project should take the form of a Node package, with all of the attendant items associated with that. The following three script commands should work in your package:\n npm install - Install dependencies for your package. npm test - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app. npm run - Command to bring up all parts of the app/system\u0026rsquo;s server scripts.  Your team is responsible for incorporating the following specifications and deliverables into your final project:\n Back-end specifications  API built on whatever framework you choose. You can build an API that interacts with other APIs as well in order to integrate them. API root endpoint at http://HOST/app/. Should create (if nonexistent) and interact with a database of users and interactions (this can be logs, even). These can be separate databases for different microservices or separate tables in one database. It is up to your team\u0026rsquo;s decisions. Database can be of any type you choose.   Front-end specifications  Give users the ability to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account. Interactions with the front end should be logged in a database.   Database specifications  User database - registration details (username, email address, etc.) Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)   Documentation  License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been. README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions /docs/ directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory shoud also house an archive of your planning documentation. Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation) User instructions in the interface   Demo video to be presented in class on either 21 or 26 April Self/group evaluation (Individual group members: this is part of the final exam for the course.)  Logistics You will be working in a small team (up to 5 people) for the final project assignment.\nYour team will be responsible for planning the project, determining roles, and then employing a collaborative workflow to build out your project. Different people will be interested in different parts of the project. Not everyone has to do the same things, nor should they.\nYour team will also be responsible for meeting with an LA to check in weekly over the next few weeks to help you make progress through the assignment.\nThe project teams will be managed through GitHub classroom. Teams are created/assigned when you accept the assignment. So, if you have a group of people you want to work with, the best way to set this up is to meet and accept the assignment at the same time so that you can choose the team together. GH classroom is configured to cut off teams at 5 people.\nUsing collaboration features on GitHub The initial README.md file in your team\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repo has some beginning steps instructions in it. It is replicated below.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66  # STOP!  Accept the final assignment a99 invite here: https://classroom.github.com/a/IbwBAA8J If you have done that already, then proceed. You MUST accept the assignment via the link above before you do ANYTHING else. # a99 Final Project  ## Summary  COMP426 final project template repository. All your code and documentation goes here. Change this text to be a brief description of your final project. Put the name of your project in the header above. You will change everything below to be the main technical documentation, as outlined below. ## First steps  Other steps that you will need to take after your team has accepted the assignment: 1. Choose a license and update the LICENSE file accordingly. 2. Edit this README.md file and use it as the main location of your technical documentation with links out to information contained under `/docs/`. 3. Create a `/docs/` directory for more elaborate documentation of your API, planning notes, etc. 4. Make sure that all of your team members have access to the repository as administrators. 5. Create a project under the **Projects** tab. Use this to manage your planning. Create a To-do list, etc. Explore the tools available and user them to manage your project. 7. Assign team roles and include a listing of those roles in this README.md file or in another file under `/docs/`. 8. Then put your entire development workflow in this repository. 9. Use **Pull requests** to propose changes and incorporate them into your code from various team members. 10. Use **Issues** to identify and track bugs and also to communicate about various aspects of the project. ## Team mangement  Plan to meet with your team ASAP. Talk through identifying roles within your team. Try to figure out what each of you are good at/enjoy doing and try to work out roles that incorporate that. Some basic roles you will want to consider: 1. A review manager - someone to review pull requests and merge or reject them and manage the related discussions 2. A plan manager - someone to keep an eye on the overall plan and keep the project tab/to-do list up to date 3. A documentation manager - someone to keep the documentation in order and identify what is missing and needs to be documented 4. A release manager - someone to manage the packaging and release process for your prototype package 5. A project manager - someone keeping track of all the moving parts and make sure that everything that needs to happen is happening. 5. Roles for team members to take charge or different parts of the project. Possible roles: 1. Front end lead 2. Back end lead 3. Database lead 4. Design lead 5. Etc. You will notice that there are more roles than people in your group. That is because you will all be doing a hybrid job of managing a thing while working on other things. ## Check in with instructional staff  Schedule a few times throughout the rest of the semester for your team to check-in with your assigned instructional staff member during their scheduled office hours. ## Assignment instructions  And that is about all you need to get started. All the rest of the assignment instructions are available at: https://comp426.johndmart.in/a/99 Good skill and be creative!   Pull requests Your team must use the fork and pull requests feature in GitHub to manage contributions, changes, and discussions about your code and documentation. This makes everything a lot easier and you are less likely to overwrite someone elses work, run into merge conflicts, etc. It is a built-in collaborative workflow.\nIssues Additionally, use the issues feature to manage bug-fixing and feature discussions. It makes things easier to keep track of. It also helps the instructional staff help you because there will be context and documentation related to your project that we can review when we meet with your team during office hours.\nProjects There is a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; tab available in your team repo. Create a project board in the class GH organization and attach it to your team.\nThis is a great place to organize your work rather than relying on email, Google docs, Groupme, etc. This also allows us (the instructional staff) to see how your project is progressing and to help you with questions and issues because it will give us context.\nLicense your work In addition to the README above, you will find a LICENSE file in your team\u0026rsquo;s repo. This is provided as a placeholder so that you may replace it with the license of your choice.\nThe placeholder file contains some information about choosing a license and how to include it in your repository. Read through the links in this file and try out the decision tools to prepare for having a discussion with your team about licensing.\nMake sure that the license specified in your Node package.json file matches that in your LICENSE file.\nYou will want to change the text in this file to be the text of the license for your project. Information about choosing a license can be found here: [Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/) [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) [Browse Software Licenses and Summaries](https://tldrlegal.com/licenses/browse) [How to choose a license for your own work](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.en.html) - GNU Operating System [Public license selector](https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/) - Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÚFAL), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University Expectations The expectations for this project is something along the lines of a working prototype. It does not have to be beautiful, it just has to work for the most part. And it does not have to be feature rich, it just has to do some pretty basic things.\nI expect and encourage inter-team collaboration as well. If there is something that your team finds useful: create a discussion in our class organization about it!\nThe repositories for this project will be created under the course organization as open source. This is intentional to encourage you to share things and learn from what your peers are doing.\nFinally, be creative!\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that what you build has to be earth-shattering. It can be whatever your team wants it to be.\nPublic health as focus I have suggested building apps or systems for this project that relate to public health for several reasons, enumerated below.\n We are in the midst of an ongoing public health emergency. Focusing on what we can do in this context should help us better understand what is happening and how we can work within it/survive it. Public health is and has been a very hot field in recent years/decades in the tech sector. Public health research is increasingly a field that depends on computation, data, and information management methods. There is A LOT of work to be done in this area. Public health is a real, meaningful, and crucial area of thought and work for the current iteration of the human project. We need a wide variety of engagement with this area. SAVE THE WORLD. Or, at least try. And, in the process, maybe find a way to make something at least incrementally better.  You\u0026rsquo;ll have your whole careers to do boring stuff just because someone tells you or to be the someone telling someone to do boring stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m giving you an opportunity to do something that is engaging, timely, and addresses problems that we are experiencing in real time. We learn better when we are engaged in meaningful action that co-creates new things/knowledge/ways of knowing/ways of doing.\nSo, BE CREATIVE, and do interesting things!\n","description":"Create a public health information app or system using an interface to interact with a  backend API \u0026 database.","id":30,"section":"a","tags":null,"title":"a99 Final Project","uri":"https://comp426.johndmart.in/a/99/"},{"content":"Bash is the name of the shell and command language that we use most frequently in Linux and other UNIX clones.

The function of an API is to translate from one platform/piece of software to another.\nAn API call is a process through which requests are made and data is retrieved from an API by a client. It looks something like this:\n A client makes a request for some data. The requested data is retrieved from an external resource. The data is delivered to the client.  Data can also be manipulated by the API if write actions are permitted.\n A client requests that new data be added and supplies that data. The request is processed by some sort of middleware that interacts with an external resource. Confirmation of receipt and is returned to the client.  RESTful services and CRUD operations REST stands for \u0026ldquo;REpresentational State Transfer\u0026rdquo; and the architecture was originally proposed in a doctoral dissertation at University of California, Irvine by Roy Fielding in 2000.\nThe architecture for a RESTful service meets the following constraints:\n It has a client-server architecture: the user interface is separate from data storage. You will see this referred to as \u0026ldquo;front-end\u0026rdquo; (client) and \u0026ldquo;back-end\u0026rdquo; (server). It is stateles: all requests from the client must contain all information necessary for the server to process the request. State information has to remain on the client and cannot be stored on the server. It must have a client-side cache: this reduces the number of requests made to the server because the client can reuse information that it already has. It must have a uniform interface: this means that the architecture of the client-server interaction is simplified so that the two can be changed independently while still maintaining the same functionality. A uniform interface, as defined, has 4 parts:  Resources: Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) that identify resources Representation manipulation: a representation of a resource must contain all of the information necessary to modify the resources itself. Self-contained messages: messages must include all information necessary to interpret them. Hypermedia as state: Clients communicate application state through requested URIs, body contents, query-string parameters, and request headers. Servers communicate application state back to clientsas URIs to retrieve objects, body contents, response codes, and response headers.   It must be a layered system: this restricts knowledge to the immediate layer with which the client is interacting by setting up a hierarchy of intermediaries. This is where middleware and distributed resources come into play. It must be capable of code-on-demand: this means that if the API documentation is avaialable, then it should be possible to create or extend a client based on the available endpoints. This constraint is optional, but it does mean that even if documentation is not available, it should be possible to reverse-engineer API calls.  HTTP methods and status codes You will want to familiarize yourself with REST API terminology and structure. Pay special attention to HTTP methods and status codes.\nThe REST API Tutorial\nSQL databases SQL is a language for interacting with data held in databases. SQL uses \u0026ldquo;statements\u0026rdquo; to structure queries. Statements are effectively commands and are (sort of) human readable.\nSome examples of SQL statements relevant to this class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6  CREATE TABLE table1 ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, var1 TEXT, var2 TEXT ) INSERT INTO table1 (var1, var2) VALUES (somedata, someotherdata) SELECT * FROM table1 SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id = 5 UPDATE table1 SET var1 = COALESCE(somenewdata,var1), var2 = COALESCE(othernewdata,var2) WHERE id = 5 DELETE * FROM table1 WHERE id = 5   Familiarize yourself with how SQL statements work. There are many, many resources available online.\n w3c SQL Tutorial SQL Tutorial for Beginners  We are using SQLite3 for this course, which implements SQL in locally stored database files that do not require a server. The syntax is basically the same, with a few differences.\nWe will be using a JS implementation of SQLite3 called better-sqlite. Full documentation of that implemntation is available here.\nExpress.js Express.js is a \u0026ldquo;minimalist\u0026rdquo; web framework that can be used to create both front- and backend applications in JavaScript. We will be using it to develop an API and consider its frontend components as well.\nExpress will be the main point of translation for connecting API endpoints to a database in our assignments.\nTranslation table The following is a table of \u0026ldquo;verbs\u0026rdquo; related to different components of our API ecosystem. This is provided to demonstrate how they relate to one another across languages and frameworks in both conceptual and practical terms.\n   CRUD SQL HTTP Express What does it do?     Create INSERT POST app.post() Makes a new record.   Read SELECT GET app.get() Retrieves an existing record.   Update (replace) REPLACE PUT app.put() Searches for a record and overwrites it. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the record is createed.   Update (modify) UPDATE PATCH app.patch() Modifies the information in an existing record.
