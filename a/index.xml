The purpose of this is assignment is to get familiar with the tools that we will be using in COMP 426 for the rest of the semester as well as the assignment submission process.
Note that this first assignment, a00, is graded only for general completion. Future assignments will be much deeper in scope, and you should expect to spend significantly more time on them.

NOTE: As of the release of this assignment on 2022-01-20, the autograder is not yet configured. SO, do not worry if there isn&amp;rsquo;t any test output. When it is, GH will run the action and then you will be able to see the output. I will have it configured shortly (i.e., probably on Friday 2022-01-21).

Creating a API In this assignment, you are going to convert the functions that you wrote for a02 to emulate a simple random coin flip and then do things with the resulting information. The focus of the assignment is not necessarily on creating basic API endpoints in Node using Express.js.
The instructions for this are very sparse because I want you to be creative in how you approach this.</description>

Logging transactions and handling errors This assignment for COMP 426 will help you to create and connect a database and to record access logs and test errors for your API server from a03 with some middleware. This is an important piece of building an API, because it allows you to break down what happened if something goes wrong. It also helps other developers use and deploy your software.</description>
